		<p>Today has been a crazy day. I am a complete moron learning to operate my new MacBook, much less understand the code that's being taught at a fast pace. Hopefully I can start grasping this information better and can learn the shortcuts to navigate this new toy! Otherwise, it's going to be a really long 12 weeks complete with a lot of head banging, beers and tears.</p>

			<p>My hope is that when I get home I can take some deep breaths and really focus in on what our fearless leader has taught us today. My goal is to get this page finished before 11pm so I can then do all of the other homework that has presented to us newbies. Also, it is my hope that I can begin to navigate around this new laptop as it is a bit more complicated than I would have originally imagined.</p>

			<p>All of us in this class have an amazing opportunity in front of us. Never in my wildest imagination would I have thought I would be in this position six months ago. I look forward to the challenges ahead in hopes of reaching ultimate tech nerd status!</p>
